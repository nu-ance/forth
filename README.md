# forth
Just a general FORTH implementation I'm messing with.

I feel the need to say I have yet to fully absorb and understand the philosophy behind FORTH.
This is a VERY basic implementation (I'm sure it's not even Turing complete.)

* It doesn't have words (you can see slight hints of it in the code)
* I don't like realloc() (read: can't use it well) so it's pretty limited in things like token length

But it's closer to FORTH than anything else.
